Check off initial ball. Check all balls from each one added but skip if it's already added.
Have some sort of cluster making state while calculating a cluster.
When a cluster has completed calculating, destroy the entire thing.

Pseudocode


List<Ball> m_BallsInCluster

CreateCluster(

AddBall(Vec2Int StartIndex, Vec2Int NextIndex, ref Cluster)
{
//if(!(Ball) in cluster)
//m_BallInCluster.Add(Ball)
}

CheckValidIndex(Vec2Int Index)
{
//if(
